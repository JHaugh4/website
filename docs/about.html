            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>My name is Joseph Haugh and I am a functional programming enthusiast who has his masters in CS. I currently work as a faculty lecturer at the University of New Mexico CS department. I fell in love with Haskell a few years ago when taking a declarative programming course and havenâ€™t looked back. I now have the honor to be teaching the very same class that gifted me with the joy of writing Haskell! My main interests are general Haskell programming, type theory, and CS eduction. I hope to pursue a PhD soon where I can combine these interests!</p>
