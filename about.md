title: About
---

My name is Joseph Haugh and I am a functional programming enthusiast who has his masters in CS. I currently works as a faculty lecturer at the University of New Mexico Computer Science department. I fell in love with Haskell a few years ago when taking a declarative programming course. I now have the honor to be teaching the very same class that gifted me with the joy of writing Haskell. My main interests are general Haskell programming, type theory, and CS eduction. I hope to pursue a PhD soon where I can hopefully combine these interests!
